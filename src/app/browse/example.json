    "description": "Although Ponta da Piedade is typically filled with tourists, I still recommend checking it out. I regret that I didn’t spend more time there! I knew I wanted to make a boat trip during my time in the Algarve but ended up doing this at Benagil beach to see the famous Benagil Cave (side note: it was a little expensive but worth snapping a photo here). In my opinion, if you’re hoping to see grottos and save a little cash, considering going on one of the boat tours here at Ponta da Piedade. This location offers activities such as hiking, kayaking, and stand up paddleboarding.",
